# covid-console

This is a nerdy COVID-19 tracking app built in my spare time for fun.  To the
extent that I will continue having time and enthusiasm for the project, it will
remain a work in progress.

The backend is relatively straightforward pandas data manipulation.  The
frontend is built with Gatsby and React.

There's a ton of tech debt.
