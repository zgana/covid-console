        There are plenty of resources for inspecting the current status and history of the
        COVID-19 pandemic.  This is an effort (by a data scientist with very little prior
        experience with React and D3) to offer an interface to some specific trends I've
        been following, plus a commandline-like interface on the homepage for "fun".

    </Layout>
